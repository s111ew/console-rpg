Skills I aim to develop through working on this project:

1. Use Node.js to run and test JS code outside of the browser environment.
2. Maintain an up-to-date commit record on Git/Github.
3. Experiment with different types of functions/callbacks.
4. Work with conditional loops.
5. Basic manipulation of the DOM with JS (on game initialisation).
6. Work with array objects.
